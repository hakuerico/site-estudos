    <h2>Letra:</h2>

    <pre>
        So
        So long
        So long ago
        There wasn't anyone out there I thought I needed to know
        But no more
        When I find the day leave my mind in the evening just as the day before

        I saw the window was open
        The cool air
        I don't know what you saw there
        Don't know what you saw in me
        Sometimes I want to be enough for you
        Don't ask
        Know that it's understood
        There's not enough of me

        I saw that something was broken
        I've crossed the line
        I'll point you to a better time
        A safer place to be
        Sometimes I want to be enough for you
        Don't ask
        Know that it's done no good

        Sometimes I want to be enough for you
        Don't ask
        Know that it's done no good
        
    </pre>
